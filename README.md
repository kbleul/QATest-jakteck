# Hello, This is JakTech.

## Take this exam and deliver on time.

Yohannes Mekonnen, \[04/26/23\]

## Exam instructions:

1. Clone the project from your email invite
2. Run yarn to install dependencies
3. Use yarn run dev command to run the project
4. The project is a simple react app with a text form and two buttons. After
   inputting a github username and clicking submit it will generate the
   username, bio and profile picture for the given user.
5. Your task is to perform different types of tests to make sure the
   app works correctly.
6. Write a test for the component , which should include
   - Test the api works properly by mocking the api
   - Test what happens when submit button is clicked with no input value
   - Test what happens when user is found and all items(avatar, name, and bio) are viewed
   - Test what happens when user does not exists and user not found is returned
   - Test that all states are resorted to original value when reset button is clicked
7. Perform an automated end to end testing 
   - Test the complete user journey, user inputs username then get result

### Notes

- You can use Jest / React testing library or any other
  library you want for step number
- You should perform end to end testing using playwright library
- And finally provide a small test report for the tests


### Notes

- If you reach the api limit while doing the test just connect to the internet using a vpn,
  if you're aleady using a vpn, turn it of and connect again so it can assign you a new ip address
  

> After completing your tasks, push it to your own github repo and add
> this username(johhann (https://github.com/johhann)) as your
> collaborator, so that we can clone and examine your work.
